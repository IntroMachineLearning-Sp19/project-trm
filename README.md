## Install Instructions
Python 3.6+ is required for all versions of this project.

The final version of the project is run using the fastai library.
Install instructions can be found on their github page: https://github.com/fastai/fastai

Previous versions require the following libraries:
numpy
pytorch
sklearn
PIL
tqdm
pandas

Most of these libraries are installed with anaconda automatically, which is the suggested method of install for all of the packages as it handles dependecies gracefully.
